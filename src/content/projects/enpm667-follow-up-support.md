## Overview
Reproduced and evaluated a follow-up support control framework for machining
thin-walled workpieces with time-varying stiffness.

## Key contributions
- Modeled position-dependent workpiece stiffness and pneumatic actuation dynamics.
- Ran matched controller comparisons with consistent time steps and constraints.
- Quantified accuracy vs. effort trade-offs across CFC and FLC controllers.

## Results
- Achieved lower tracking error with CFC (~12% improvement) at slight effort increase.

## Tech notes
- Parameter studies, reproducible simulations, and controlled comparisons.
